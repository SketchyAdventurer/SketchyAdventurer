- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SketchyAdventurer or you can call me Mike up to you.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in gaming, drawing, adventures, and stories from others.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# for Unity.
- I am currently new to game creation and C# itself.
- I know some programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, Java,  but just the basics of each.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at TheSketchyAdventurer@gmail.com or on here.
- If there is anything I can help with or if there is any problem with my code or just want to talk, send me a message!

As of right now I am in the learning stages of Unity and have no projects I am working on. Once I start working on Projects I will update my page further.
Thank you!
